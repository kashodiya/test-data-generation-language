# Test Data Generation Language (TDGL) - Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive testing of the Test Data Generation Language (TDGL) tool. The testing covers various features of the language, including schema validation, data generation, and export formats.

## Test Environment

- **Date**: August 23, 2025
- **Environment**: Linux
- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **Package Manager**: uv

## Features Tested

### 1. Schema Validation

The `validate` command was tested with different schema files:

- **Simple Table Schema**: The tool successfully validated the basic schema with tables, fields, and constraints.
- **Advanced Custom Types Schema**: The tool successfully validated the schema with custom types and complex constraints.

Both validations produced warnings about missing primary keys, which appears to be a known issue or limitation in the current implementation.

### 2. Data Generation

The `generate` command was tested with different schema files and options:

- **Simple Table Schema**: Successfully generated data for all tables defined in the schema.
- **Advanced Custom Types Schema**: Successfully generated data for all tables with custom types.
- **Generation Strategies**: The "faker" strategy was tested and worked correctly.

### 3. Export Formats

The following export formats were tested:

- **JSON**: Successfully exported data to JSON format with proper structure.
- **CSV**: Successfully exported data to CSV format with headers and proper field separation.

### 4. Schema Display

The `show` command was tested:

- Successfully displayed schema files with syntax highlighting and line numbers.

### 5. Grammar and Parser

The grammar and parser components were indirectly tested through all operations:

- The parser successfully parsed different schema files with various constructs.
- The grammar supports a wide range of features including custom types, constraints, and generation directives.
- There were some warnings about implicit token definitions in the grammar file during setup.

## Test Results

### Schema Validation Tests

| Test Case | Schema File | Result | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Basic Schema Validation | examples/basic/simple_table.tdg | PASS | Warnings about primary keys |
| Advanced Schema Validation | examples/advanced/custom_types.tdg | PASS | Warnings about custom types and primary keys |
| Custom Schema Validation | custom_test.tdg | PASS | Warnings about custom types and primary keys |

### Data Generation Tests

| Test Case | Schema File | Format | Result | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Generate Simple Data (JSON) | examples/basic/simple_table.tdg | JSON | PASS | Generated 400 records across 4 tables |
| Generate Advanced Data (JSON) | examples/advanced/custom_types.tdg | JSON | PASS | Generated 500 records across 5 tables |
| Generate Simple Data (CSV) | examples/basic/simple_table.tdg | CSV | PASS | Generated 400 records across 4 tables |
| Generate Custom Test Data (JSON) | custom_test.tdg | JSON | PASS | Generated 300 records across 3 tables |

### Export Format Tests

| Format | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| JSON | PASS | Proper JSON structure with nested objects |
| CSV | PASS | Proper headers and field separation |

## Data Quality Assessment

### JSON Output

The generated JSON data shows:
- Proper structure with arrays of objects
- Correct field names matching the schema
- Data types generally matching the schema definitions
- Some null values present where not explicitly disallowed
- Some negative integer values where constraints weren't specified

### CSV Output

The generated CSV data shows:
- Proper headers matching field names
- Comma-separated values
- Proper handling of string values
- Some empty fields where null values are present

## Issues and Observations

1. **Negative Integer Values**: The generator produces negative integer values for fields like "age" where constraints weren't specified.
2. **Null Values**: Some fields marked as "not null" still contain null values in the generated data.
3. **Custom Type Warnings**: The validator warns about custom types being identical to base types, suggesting constraints should be added.
4. **Primary Key Warnings**: The validator warns about tables not having primary keys, even when they are defined in the schema.
5. **Parser Warnings**: During setup, there were multiple warnings about implicit token definitions in the grammar file.
6. **Custom Type Constraints**: Custom types with constraints like `range(18, 100)` for Age don't seem to be enforced in the generated data.
7. **Enum Values**: Enum type constraints don't appear to be enforced in the generated data.

## Conclusion

The Test Data Generation Language tool successfully validates schemas and generates test data in different formats. The tool is functional and meets its core requirements, but there are some issues with data quality and validation that could be improved.

The DSL provides a clear and concise way to define schemas, constraints, and generation strategies. The command-line interface is straightforward and provides helpful feedback.

## Recommendations

1. Fix the issue with negative integer values for fields like "age" where it doesn't make sense.
2. Ensure "not null" constraints are properly enforced during data generation.
3. Improve the parser to reduce warnings about implicit token definitions.
4. Enhance the validation to properly recognize primary keys defined in the schema.
5. Ensure custom type constraints like range() and pattern() are properly enforced during data generation.
6. Ensure enum values are properly enforced during data generation.
7. Add more export formats like SQL or XML.
8. Implement more sophisticated data generation strategies for realistic data.
9. Add better error messages when constraints are violated.
10. Implement a way to specify relationships between tables more explicitly for data generation.
