# Implementation Stories for Test Data Generation Language

This document outlines the features that need to be implemented to fully support custom types in the Test Data Generation Language.

## Custom Type Support

### 1. Custom Type Registration
**Description:** Implement the ability to register custom type definitions in the type registry.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Parser identifies `type` declarations in the schema
- Custom types are added to the type registry with appropriate metadata
- Custom types can be referenced by name in field declarations

### 2. Type Definition Processing
**Description:** Enhance the semantic analyzer to process `type` declarations in the schema.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Semantic analyzer recognizes and validates type declarations
- Type declarations are processed before field declarations
- Error handling for invalid type declarations

### 3. Type Inheritance
**Description:** Implement support for custom types that inherit from primitive types.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Custom types can inherit properties from primitive types
- Type inheritance chain is properly tracked
- Base type constraints are inherited by derived types

### 4. Constraint Application
**Description:** Apply custom type constraints during validation and data generation.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Constraints defined on custom types are applied to fields using those types
- Multiple constraints can be combined (e.g., pattern + length for string types)
- Constraints are validated during schema validation

### 5. Type Resolution
**Description:** Enhance the validator to resolve custom type references to their base types.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Validator can resolve custom type references to their underlying primitive types
- Type resolution works for nested custom types
- Appropriate error messages when type resolution fails

### 6. Grammar Rule Implementation
**Description:** Complete the visitor implementation for custom type references in the grammar.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AST builder correctly processes custom type references
- Type definitions are properly represented in the AST
- Grammar supports all required syntax for custom types

### 7. Type Validation
**Description:** Implement validation for custom types and their usage.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Validator checks that custom types are defined before use
- Validator ensures custom types are used correctly
- Circular type references are detected and reported

### 8. Data Generation for Custom Types
**Description:** Enhance the generation engine to handle custom types.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generation engine understands custom type constraints
- Generated data conforms to custom type specifications
- Custom types with complex constraints (like patterns) generate valid data

## Implementation Priority

1. Custom Type Registration & Type Definition Processing
2. Type Resolution & Grammar Rule Implementation
3. Type Validation & Type Inheritance
4. Constraint Application & Data Generation for Custom Types

## Testing Strategy

Each feature should include:
- Unit tests for the specific functionality
- Integration tests with existing components
- End-to-end tests using example schemas
- Validation of generated data against type constraints
